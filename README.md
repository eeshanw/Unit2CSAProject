In this project we utilized the Pandas and MatPlotLib libraries in Python in
order to analyze data from a data frame that included the statistics of all NFL
players that threw a pass between 2007 and 2017.

What we did:
  Utilized Pandas library to analyze/sort through the data
  Utilized Matplotlib library to demonstrate how graphing can be done using
  python, and how graphs can be used to display quantitative and categorical
  data.

How to use the program:
  - In order to use the program you must install the following:
      Updated version of Python running
      Installed Pandas library
      Installed Matplotlib library
  - The .csv file must be in the same folder or directory as the python program
    or the code will not run due to the reference file being in a different
    location
  - Once it is run, the program will prompt the user through a series of choices
    that allow them to view whichever stats they choose
  - The program will return an empty database or will simply quit if an
    unsupported value is entered into some of the questions
